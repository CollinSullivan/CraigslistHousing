      User interest for playlists is increasing as current music streaming services become more and
more popular. Most notably, Spotify – the world’s most popular audio streaming subscription service with 456m users, including 195m subscribers, across 183 markets as noted by <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/company-info/">Spotify</a>– has captured the hearts and ears of users with their engaging podcasts and wide selection of artists. 
      <br>
      <br>
      However, the ability listen to custom playlists has proven in itself to be the highest drawing point for the platform, as Spotify created playlists such as Pop Rising and RapCaviar garner millions of loyal followers and is now credited with launching countless careers, while personalized algorithm generated playlists like Discover Weekly are made especially to match the user’s unique musical tastes. In fact, in their <a href="https://dima.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DiMA-Streaming-Forward-Report.pdf">2018 Annual Music Report</a>, the Digital Media Association states that 54% of consumers say that playlists are replacing albums in their listening habits. And as proven by <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3240323.3240342?casa_token=aikmhywEuVgAAAAA:155YPZ8CbhNqAJXv-NLdxcJ7Iy9gC5N1urF_Qvby4ZMBc-59iJnctbjeIxWXzBekU0pP8JoBp98b">The Million Playlist Dataset</a> that this article analyzes, users love creating playlist most of all. 
      <br>
      <br>
        Users create playlists that are to be enjoyed when in a specific mood (e.g. sad and happy), or when participating in a specific activity (e.g. driving, working out, focusing), while other users choose to group music together categorically (e.g. by genre, artist, year). Whatever the reason may be – and as noted by <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2018/05/introducing-the-million-playlist-dataset-and-recsys-challenge-2018/">Spotify R&D</a>– through 2018, Spotify users have created over 2 billion playlists! 
      <br>
      <br>
        And Through the use of our dataset that includes one million playlists – as sampled over the aforementioned 2 billion public playlists on Spotify – created by users between January 2010 and November 2017, we are able to determine trends in playlist specifics.

        It should be noted that the growth in streaming platform audiences has translated into more songs being streamed more often. As tracked by MRC Data in their <a href="https://mrcdatareports.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MRC_YEAREND_2021_US_FNL.pdf">2021 Year-End Report</a>, global on-demand audio song streams have increased 26.3% to a total 2.74 trillions streams between the years of 2020 and 2021. Under these circumstances not only do the big hits keep getting bigger, but there are more of them than ever before. 
      <br>

        However, we may ask ourselves: what goes into the playlists users are creating and what makes a song so popular? Do the effects of energy or danceability affect it in any way? [See if there is a correlation between these stats]
