      User interest for playlists is increasing as current music streaming services become more and more popular. Most notably, Spotify – the world’s most popular audio streaming subscription service with 456m users, including 195m subscribers, across 183 markets as noted by <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/company-info/">Spotify</a>– has captured the hearts and ears of users with their engaging podcasts and wide selection of artists. 
      <br>
      <br>
      However, the ability listen to custom playlists has proven in itself to be the highest drawing point for the platform, as Spotify created playlists such as Pop Rising and RapCaviar garner millions of loyal followers and is now credited with launching countless careers, while personalized algorithm generated playlists like Discover Weekly are made especially to match the user’s unique musical tastes. In fact, in their <a href="https://dima.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DiMA-Streaming-Forward-Report.pdf">2018 Annual Music Report</a>, the Digital Media Association states that 54% of consumers say that playlists are replacing albums in their listening habits. And as proven by <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3240323.3240342?casa_token=aikmhywEuVgAAAAA:155YPZ8CbhNqAJXv-NLdxcJ7Iy9gC5N1urF_Qvby4ZMBc-59iJnctbjeIxWXzBekU0pP8JoBp98b">The Million Playlist Dataset</a> (see <b>Appendix B</b> that this article analyzes, users love creating playlist most of all. 
      <br>
      <br>
      With over 60,000 tracks uploaded daily, Spotify users have the ability to create playlists as they please. Users create playlists that are to be enjoyed when in a specific mood (e.g. sad and happy), or when participating in a specific activity (e.g. driving, working out, focusing), while other users choose to group music together categorically (e.g. by genre, artist, year). Whatever the reason may be – and as noted by <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2018/05/introducing-the-million-playlist-dataset-and-recsys-challenge-2018/">Spotify R&D</a>– through 2018, Spotify users have created over 2 billion playlists! 
      <br>
      <br>
        And through the use of our dataset that includes one million playlists – as sampled over the aforementioned 2 billion public playlists on Spotify – created by users between January 2010 and November 2017, we search for trends in playlist specifics and delve into questions that happened to arise as the data was analyzed. For instance, we asked ourselves: do users create playlists that are largely instrumental songs, but can also be easily danced to – the answer is absolutely not! Yet, questions like this helped us observe trends in what types of playlists are being created.

      <br>
      The first key takeaway is that Spotify users tend to not create playlists that are largely live music, more acoustical genres like classical music, or exclusively speech-like the recordings (e.g. talk shows, audio books, poetry). But does that really shock anyone? 
      <br>
      <br>
      Our second takeaway is that a large distribution of spotify playlists are either very easy to dance to (which encompass most party playlists), have a high level of energy (which encompass playlists that are meant for specific high-energy activities), or both! And it turns out that these two characteristics are highly correlated to each other, as energetic tracks are meant to feel fast, loud, and noisy which songs that are easy to dance to typically are.
      <br>
      <br>
      Lastly, with the introduction of the characteristic valence (see <b>Appendix A</b>) we are able to ask ourselves: do Spotify users make more sad playlists or are they more likely to make happy ones. It just so happens that the distribution of playlists based on moods is evenly distributed; meaning that users enjoy creating playlists for every mood.
      <br>
      <br>
      However, you must have come to this article wondering what makes some playlists more popular than others? When searching for an answer to what makes a playlist grow in popularity we decided to track a number of attributes, those being: the <span style="color:blue"><b>number of albums</b></span>, <span style="color:green"><b>number of artists</b></span>,and <span style="color:pink"><b>number of tracks</b></span>, and their individual impacts on the average popularity of a playlist.

Interestingly, we observed that a majority of playlists achieve an average level of popularity (see <b>Appendix A/B</b> for definition) by having a large number of songs encompassing a wide variety of artists and albums. But while it is possible for a playlist to become very popular (have a score of 85+) with over 100 tracks, most playlists of extreme popularity tend to only have less than 100 songs. We interpret this by assuming that Spotify users typically will gravitate towards playlists that are finely curated, since the more tracks a playlists has tend to feel dilluted when listened to over long periods of time.
    <br>
    <br>
      It should be noted that the growth in streaming platform audiences has not only translated into popularity for playlists but also songs are now being streamed more often. As tracked by MRC Data in their <a href="https://mrcdatareports.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MRC_YEAREND_2021_US_FNL.pdf">2021 Year-End Report</a>, global on-demand audio song streams have increased 26.3% to a total 2.74 trillions streams between the years of 2020 and 2021. Under these circumstances not only do the big hits keep getting bigger, but there are more of them than ever before. 
      <br>
      <br>
      It might be completely obvious to state that songs stick in our heads for all sorts of reasons. Some of us like our songs to be angsty and exciting, while others enjoy those that are mellow and melancholic; and while there’s no one single foolproof formula or set of elements that generate a hit song or make us to stream them endlessly – if there was such an algorithm, it would be guaranteed to at least be NP-hard – as with any art form, what’s popular and gains traction with a wide audience comes down to such a chaotic blend of factors that is impossible to decipher.
      <br>
      <br>
        However, we may ask ourselves: what goes into the playlists users are creating and what makes a song so popular? Do the effects of a song's beats per minute or its danceability affect it in any way? And It turns out that trends do exist.

        Both energy and danceability seem to have an outsized impact in influencing a song's popularity. While these characteristics don't exactly have a 1:1 correlation with each other, many popular songs are either easy to dance to or are more energetic.
      <br>
      <br>
        Alternatively, valence or a track’s mood (see <b>Appendix A</b>) has nearly no impact on a song’s popularity as a song can be either sad or happy and still become popular; as we all have in mind that one sad song that we cannot take off repeat.
      <br>
      <br>
        However, while inspecting the relationship between a song's qualities and its popularity, it may be equally important to 
         remember that the song characteristics themselves might be correlated. With the below visualization, one can 
         choose two characteristics for songs to see if a clear relationship exists.

        A few clear correlations are shown with this visualization. First, as energy increases, acousticness tends to decrease. This makes absolute sense since - as defined in <b>Appendix A</b> - a high level of energy is attributed to a song's intensity and activity. Like when is the last time you heard of a head-banging instrumental track? Probably never!
      <br>
      <br>
        Second, while we have talked about energy and danceability as a pair several times throughout this article, we ultimately observed that as energy increases, danceability increases up to a point, then decreases for the extremely high energy songs.
      <br>
      <br>        
        And finally, while there are many highly-acoustic, highly-instrumental songs and non-acoustic, highly-instrumental songs, there are very few songs that fall in the middle.

    <h2>Appendix A</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Popularity:</b> The popularity of a track is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are. Generally speaking, songs that are being played a lot now will have a higher popularity than songs that were played a lot in the past. Duplicate tracks (e.g. the same track from a single and an album) are rated independently. Artist and album popularity is derived mathematically from track popularity.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Danceability:</b> Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0 is least danceable and 100 is most danceable.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Valence:</b> Measure from 0 to 100 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Energy: </b> Energy is a measure from 0 to 100 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Speechiness:</b> Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 100 the attribute value. Values above 66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 33 and 66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Acousticness:</b>  A confidence measure from 0 to 100 of whether the track is acoustic. 100 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Instrumentalness:</b> Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. "Ooh" and "aah" sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly "vocal". The closer the instrumentalness value is to 100, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Liveness:</b> Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 80 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.</li>
        </ul>

      The playlists dataset was constructed from multiple existing datasets. The spotify-millions-playlist, 
      retrieved from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityak80/spotify-millions-playlist">link</a>, 
      contains data for 1 million spotify playlists in JSON format. The raw size of this dataset was prohibitive 
      for visualizations, so we downloaded a subset of 20,000 playlists. For each playlist, some aggregate 
      attributes were already calculated (e.g. number of artists, number of albums). However, no measures of 
      Spotify-calculated variables (e.g. valence, danceability) were present.
      <br><br>
      In order to inject the playlist dataset with Spotify-variable measures, we joined the playlist dataset with 
      the Spotify Tracks Dataset retrieved from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset">link</a>. 
      If at least two tracks in a playlist were present in the Spotify Tracks Dataset, then we calculated the mean 
      values for each of the Spotify-variables and recorded these for the playlist. As such, a major limitation of this 
      dataset is that we can not account for the Spotify-variables for tracks not present in the Spotify Tracks Dataset. 
      Still, it gives insight into the character of the playlists.
