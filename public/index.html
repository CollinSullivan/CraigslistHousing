      The goal of this visualization is to portray the data of “Craigslist House and Apartment Rentals” as a set of line graphs, each indicating the yearly median price of house/apartment rentals over the course of 19 years for 10 California counties. With this visualization this group hopes that the viewer will be able to come to their own conclusions about housing prices in this particular section of the United States and be able to formulate new expectations before deciding to move to one of the ten counties measured. Here, we represent the data using a x-axis measuring years (2000 - 2018), and a y-axis measuring the median housing price (per month) that also scales with each filtered view to avoid potential data point clutter. Additionally, in order to keep true to the interactivity requirements this group implemented hovering tooltip capabilities, to enhance the user-experience; and a range slider to allow the user to filter the amount of bedrooms shown. <br>
<br>

Some alternate features/design choices we considered consisted of: 
<br>
<br>

A value slider to filter the number of bathrooms to allow a user determine mean prices at a more granular level. However, this group determined early on that this feature would be a detriment to our visualization and removed it in order to obtain a higher level of data usability and to avoid data mismatches. Meaning that with this feature implemented, we estimated that 75% of our dataset will be unusable (you wouldn’t have 5 bedrooms and 1 bathroom type scenario); while in contrast, if we didn’t include this feature, then only around 5% of the data will be unusable. <br>
<br>

A value slider to filter the number of bedrooms to a singular value. With the removal of the visualization’s bathroom filtering capabilities we were able to expand on this feature to provide the user to filter a specific range, which provides a greater level of data flexibility. 
<br>
<br>

Measuring apartment/rental pricing of individual cities, instead of counties. This group decided to move away from this representation because when using cities on this large of a data set we had too many (roughly 20) lines on the screen at once. Therefore, in order to minimize data cluttering, we made the decision to group these cities into their respective counties, as to nearly half the amount of data points shown at any given point and boost data readability. 
<br>
<br>

No color scheme. However, with a multi-color line scheme and an accompanying legend, we hoped to boost readability by making it easier to differentiate between counties at a glance.
